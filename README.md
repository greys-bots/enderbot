# Enderbot
*A starboard bot for Discord*

Enderbot is a lightweight yet powerful starboard bot for Discord. It offers unlimited starboards per server, as well as  individual starboard configurations.

## Features
### Unlimited starboards
There are currently no limits to the number of starboards that a server can have, save for channel space and emoji use. If you've got a channel and an emoji, you've got a starboard you can create.

### Individual and global configurations
This bot allows you to set tolerances on a global scale or for each individual starboard. You can also set a moderator override, or whether mods can bypass the tolerance, for each starboard you create.

### Custom emoji support
Ender supports the use of custom emoji for starboard reactions. Just set it up the same as any other starboard, and the bot will handle the logic for you.

### Simple syntax
Most of Ender's commands are simple and intuitive, and can be shortened to single letter/symbol terms. This is part of an effort to make our bots as accessible and easy to use as possible.
